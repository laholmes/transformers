# SKLearn Transformers

library of transformers for use in sklearn pipelines

transformers supported:

clip  
convert to date  
knn impute  
length  
m to km  
scale  
strip currency 

# Demo
run jupyter notebook
and open demo.ipynb

the demo takes a csv containing historical S&P500 index quotes as input (into which
I introduced some missing values etc for the purpose of test)

and runs it through a pipeline containing some of the transformers available in this library
